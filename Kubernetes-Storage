Volumes
=======
Kubernetes supports many type of volumes.A POD can use multiple types of volumes simultaneously.Volumes with Ephemeral in nature have lifetime of a POD whereas persistent volumes exist beyond the lifetime of a POD.

Types of Volumes
----------------

awsElasticBlockStore,volume mounts an AWS EBS volume into the POD.EBS volumes are persistent in nature i.e even if the POD is terminated the EBS volume and inside data won't get effected.

There are some limitations of using AWS EBS Volumes
- the node on which PODs are running should be EC2 instances
- EBS volume should be on same region and availabilty zone as the EC2 instances
- EBS only support one EC2 instance mounting a volume

Steps for using AWS EBS Volume
------------------------------
- Set label of node
  - $ kubectl label nodes <node-name> key=value
  
- Create AWS EBS
  - $ aws ec2 create-volume --availability-zone=eu-west-1a --size=10 --volume-type=gp2
  
- AWS EBS configuration : Using AWS EBS inside a POD
  
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: POD
  metadata:
    name: test-ebs
  spec:
    containers:
    - image: nginx
      name: nginx
      volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /ebs-vol-0
        name: ebs-vol
    nodeSelector:
      key=value
    volumes:
    - name: ebs-vol
    awsElasticBlockStore:
      volumeID: <ebs-volume-id>
      fsType: ext4
      partition: <partition number>

Persistent Volumes
------------------
A Persistent Volume is a storage in the cluster which has been pre-provisioned by the admin or dynamically provisioned using Stroage Classses.PVs have life-cycle beyond PODs life-cyvle.

Persistent Volume Claim
-----------------------
PVC is a request for storage by a user from PV
